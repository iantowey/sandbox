%state the general topic and give some background
  This paper investigates properties of turbulent fluid flow. Turbulent fluid flow is a complex and requires advanced mathematics to describe this motion.
  The motion of a fluid is usually though as of a group of unit fluid elements with similar physical properties, the mathematics is modelled on how the fluid motion effects a 
  single fluid element. In a turbulent flow there is mixing of fluid particles, which are stretched, distorted and mixed in knots by the flow. In this setting,
  the motion of the fluid element is highly irregular and statistical averages are used to describe the various properties of the fluid.
  Turbulent fluid flow has important application in industrial mixing applications, examples outlined cite:mixing_wiki and cite:fluid\_mixing.
      
  This paper investigates using a stochastic model to describe the \textit{mixing/turbulent} motion of a passive tracer in a fluid flow. 
  Rapid mixing or Turbulent flow is conventionally visualised as a cascade of large eddies breaking into successfully smaller eddies and the transfer of energy from these larger unstable eddies to smaller eddies.
  A passive tracer (such as a dye) is any fluid property we can measure to track fluid flow that does not influence the properties of the flow.
  Turbulent / mixing action stretches and distorts these fluid elements. The rate of stretching/distortion is described by a quantity known as the Lyapunov exponent. The solution to the stochastic model provides the 
  probability density function of the Lyapunov exponent. 
      
  In cite:main, a model of the orientation dynamics is derived based on the alignment dynamics of the tracer gradient with the straining direction of the flow. 
  The orientation dynamics model emerges from the standard advection-diffusion equation (ref eqn) for viscous fluids by introducting a vector field which describes the 
  the gradient of the tracer. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the rate-of-strain tensor associated with the orientation dynamics model are the basis from which the stochastic model for the Lyapunov exponent PDF is found.
  The stochastic fluctuations are modeled as as Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes, this is an appropriate assumption as the analysis in cite:main introduces a external random forcing in the simulation. 
  The Fokker-Planck partial differential equation associated with the stochastic model is presented, which describes the stationary solution of the stochastic model. 
  The parameters of the Fokker-Planck were choosen via the moment of the vorticity and tracer concentration from the DNS. 
  One of the aims of this project is to try and use uncertainty quanification methods to fite these parameters more accurately.

  The aim of this paper is to fully explain the equations presented in cite:main , numerically solve the vorticity , advection diffusion and the Fokker-Planck equations. Reproducing the simulation results in cite:main and
  use uncertainty quatification methods to fit the FP parameters more actually accurately.
    
  
  The advection diffusion equation is outlined. vorticity transport equation which descibes two-dimensional turbulence is then introduced, this describes the angular velocity of the fluid element about the z-axis. These two equations are solved 
  via direct numerical pesudo-spectral methods
  
  The vorticity equation is solved using a DNS pesudo-specrtal method , as is the Fokker-Planck PDE, the probabilty denstiy function of the orientation dynamics attributes are compared from the DNS and the Fokker-Planck
  stationary solution. 
   
  
  


In fluid mechanics, studying how fluids mix is a fundemental issue. The models investigated here aim to computes the mixing coefficient for steady flows. 

To visualize this in a flow, we could imagine two fluid elements in a turbulent flow moving along to two very close streamlines separating from each 
other at a rate modelled by a linear quanity known as the Lyapunov exponent.  A positive Lyapunov exponent is usually taken as an indication that the system is chaotic, 
and the fluid element experiences exponential stretching.  


The computation of the Lyapunov exponent is based on a model of the alignment dynamics of the vorticity or tracer gradient with the compressional eigenvector of the symmetric part of the strain tensor.
In \cite{align} the most probable angle of alignment is $\pi/2$, this means on average, the vorticity aligns with the compressive direction of the flow.
This allows us compute the Lyapunov exponent using the corrosponding eigenvalue and the angle between the X-axis and the compressional eigenvector.

Modelling this growth rate using direct numerical simulation (DNS) is computationally expensive, for this reason a system of stochastic differenetial equations identified in \cite{main}
are used to model the angle between the X-axis and the compressional eigenvector and hense the Lyapunov exponent at a much cheaper computational cost.

The probability density functions of the Lyapunov exponent  and the X-angle from the DNS and the stochastic model will be compared for agreement.

This work is based on the \cite{main}. This work outlines the theory of the orientation dynanics , describing the alignment of the tracer dradient with the compressional direction of the flow. The equations for vorticity and 
advection/diffusion used in the numerical simulation. Also the results of \cite{main} are reproduced.
