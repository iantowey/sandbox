A model was derived for the orientation dynamics of a fluid under idealised conditions with a specfically chosen forcing term. The model described is a coupled system of stochastic 
differential equations for the angle $X$, which is the angle between the rate of strain tensor's positive eigenvector and the x-axis. The associated Fokker-Planck equation is
dervied and the probability density function of the angle $X$ is found via numerical simulation , from this the probability density function of the Lyapunov exponent $\Lambda$ is computed.

The distributions (for $X$ and $\Lambda$) from the Fokker-Planck are checked against numerically simulation data from the vorticity and advection-diffusion equations. The vorticity and advection-diffusion equations
are solved via a pseudo-spectral method.
from this we seen thata the  and 


A more numerical method could be used to fit the parameters of the FP PDE using uncertainly quantification methods, 
The libraries documentation and examples were simple algebraic equations and time did not permit figuring how  how to encode the FP equation within the constraints of these frameworks, 

A number of open source libraries were investigated to see if suitable for to fit the DNS data aginst the FP PDE
UQ-PyL (Uncertainty Quantification Python Laboratory)  http://www.uq-pyl.com/
OpenTURNS  (Treatment of Uncertainties, Risks'N Statistics) http://www.openturns.org/

unfortunately it was not possible to encode the Fokker-Planck equation within these framework, given more th=ime this could be implemented
\cite{uqm} implements \textit{Python} code to implement these 3 methods to solve Burgers PDE. Future work could be to buid on the available code in \cite{uqm} to solve the \ref{eqn:fp}

The Navier-Stokes equation that describe the motion of a viscous fluid were introduced, from this the vorticity transport equation was dervied. This euqation is required to extract the vorticity which describes the rotation of a fluid 
particle, this will be required to extract data to fit 
The advection-diffusion equation was also analysed, this describes the concentration of the tracer. This is solved for the concentration which is also required to fit the DNS data against the model.
The orientation dynamics model is outlined , from this the SDE model is derived. The corresponding FP quation is then dervied, this was solved numerically and the results of the FP are compared to the DNS
The marginal distribution of X v the X-angle observed in the DNS, also the FP lambda distribution v DNS lambda distribution, this comarison was done visually and using the moments of the extracted distributions.
