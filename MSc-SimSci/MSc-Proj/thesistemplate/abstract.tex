A stochastic model of the orientation dynamics of a tracer gradient mixed by a steady flow is presented. The stochastic model contains a mean and random part for the X from the orientation dynamics model. 
The random components of the model are assumed to be described as Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, from this, the associated Fokker-Planck partial differential equation is derived. This models the stationary 
probability density function of the stochastic system. The probability density function of the Lyapunov exponent, which measures the level of chaotic mixing, can then be computed. The parameters of the 
Fokker-Planck equation are validated against data obtained from a numerical simulation of turbulent flow, also the density functions of the angles and Lyapunov exponent can be compared against the density 
functions from the simulated data. Methods from Uncertainty Quantification are presented, these methods may help fit the parameters of the Fokker-Planck equation better than the moments of the simulated 
data presented in other works.
